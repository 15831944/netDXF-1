netDXF
======

This is a fork of an older version of netDXF to support AUTOCAD 12 and 14

If you can, use haplokuon's excellent DXF reader and writer .net library <a href="http://netdxf.codeplex.com/"> on Codeplex</a>. This was forked simply to support AUTOCAD 14 files that are no longer supported in netDXF
